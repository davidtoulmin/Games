# Games
Text based emulations of board games I created for the command line. 

These were some games I created for the fun of coding an interesting project in my spare time.
Not my best work, as I was just learning to code at the time I wrote them, and they were
only ever for my own enjoyment. Tempted to rewrite them in better style and some of them I would
rewrite completely differently, given what I've learned since then. But thought I'd put them up to
join the comunity and to have something to present, mostly to display my enthusiasm for coding
and working on software projects.
